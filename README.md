# project_submission
Submission for the lambda solo project.

Objective:
1. Use tranfer learning to train YOLO model on a custom image to detect.
2. Once the model is working with a low error rate, add functionality for orientation detection.

Road Map
1. Collect/Create and Annotate data
2. Train/Transfer Learning YOLO model for new data
3. Test trained model on test dataset
